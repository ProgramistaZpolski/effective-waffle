Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?
- Your wisdom? :)

This is my third devchallenges project. It was the first devchallenges project where i used Javascript. During the development of this project, i learned about
the css ```float``` property. I also learned about responsivness - this time, media queries take only 6% of the css. Previously, they took over 75%!
I really liked this project.
