## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProgramistaZpolski/effective-waffle/master/weather-app/Screenshot_2020-11-07%20Weather.png)

This is a Weather App built using the OpenCage Geocoding API (https://opencagedata.com/) and OpenWeatherMap's One Call API (https://openweathermap.org/).
I didn't use the suggested MetaWeather API (https://www.metaweather.com/api/) because I found that it only supports one city in my country.
I also didn't built the ``I can request my current location weather`` because I don't have a way to test it - my computer can't really get current location since it's a desktop PC and does not have any GPS features. 


### Built With
